## Motivation

Our motivation for doing this as our project first and foremost comes from our collective enjoyment of video games. We have also had those moments when we complained about the AI in a game not being good enough and with this project, we will surely get a better idea of the process of creating AI in a game and see if we really had much room to complain or if we actually might be able to make a better AI than the ones that we were disappointed by. Similar concerns can briefly be found in Amit's Game Programming Information below in the Resources section. Regardless of our experience, the video game industry is always looking to improve in all aspects with the games being released, and this is the beginning into the kind of work needed to make those advancements from game to game. Furthermore, the types of problems we hope to look into are able to be applied outside of video games in much more generic contexts and then reapplied to the specifics of another area of programming entirely. Our efforts in making this project will also lend to us having experience desirable nonetheless the path taking in getting those experiences.
We also specifically chose to make a game as it gave us the ability to work with multiple AI techniques and gain a more broader sense of experience. We also wanted to get more experience with Unity as felt we could be more familiar with it and this let us work with it in 2D as opposed to previous experience with it only in 3D. Ultimately, we decieded that this project would give us the kinds of experiences we would like to gain one way or another and hence it coincided well with the requirements of the project.
