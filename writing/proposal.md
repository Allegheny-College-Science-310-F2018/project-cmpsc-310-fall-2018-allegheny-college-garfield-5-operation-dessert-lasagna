## 2D Platformer Proposal

The basis for our project is intended to be a simple 2D platformer video game. In the project, we hope to be able to explore various AI techniques within it so as the get a wider grasp on the techniques associated with AI. The kinds of techniques that we have thus far identified as ones we may well end up implementing in the game are the following: line of sight, image recognition of the level, and pathfinding. All three of these techniques are detailed in depth with in Development of three AI techniques for 2D platform games, found in the Resources section below. We intend to have AIs with multiple behaviours possibly incorporating multiple techniques apart of them as well. As for what kinds of tools we intend to use with the project, we are planning to use Unity, and therefore C# as well, for the creation of the game. We also plan to use the A* algorithm, with further details in the Resources section below, for implementing the pathfinding technique.
