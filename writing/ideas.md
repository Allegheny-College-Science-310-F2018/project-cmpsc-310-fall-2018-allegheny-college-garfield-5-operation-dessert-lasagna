## Ideas

### Jordan's Idea

#### Platformer Game

A relatively simple game to make, but one that requires a lot of different AI techniques.  It would also be good way to explore Unity2D.  With my experience in spriting, it could be a bit easier to have unique and interesting graphics.

### Noah's Idea

#### THEATER Lights

I came up with the idea to create a database of different incandescent theatre lights turning on and off. We could then use AI to create a generic or average light(fade/turn on) and create a simulation of this for led lights.

### Alex's Idea
