## Line of Sight

For the line of sight, we have settled upon using Brensenham's line algorithm as the way we will implement this technique. It was only fairly recently that this was deceided upon and therefore no progress has been made in coding this into the game in any way yet. While not concretely deceided upon, it is likely that our flying enemy will implement this as its AI in the game. Our goal is still to implement this technique into the game in this or similar fashion.

## Conclusion

While we have not made the most progress possible with the coding of the crucial elements of our project, we believe that the work have accomplished thus far gives us a great enough foundation to build off of with the final implementations of the proposed techniques. Along the way, we have thus far learned more about the process for making a 2D game in specific in Unity and how it differs from our experience with making a 3D game in Unity. Our challenges so far have mainly revolved around working with Unity and the C# language due to our collective inexperience with both. It also probably took us longer than it should have to find resources and settle upon the algorithms we intend to use for the implementation of the various AI techniques. Nonetheless, it has been quite the learning experience for all of us so far and besides fulfilling the requirements of the project, that is all that we can ever hope to get out of efforts like these.
