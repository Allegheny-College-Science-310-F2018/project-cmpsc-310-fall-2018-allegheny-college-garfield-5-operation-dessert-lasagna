## 2D Platformer Proposal

	In deciding upon what our project would be, we came to the conclusion that we wanted it to be one where we would be able to explore as wide a range of AI techniques as possible. To do this, we ended up on choosing to make a 2D platformer. The main problem associated with AI in 2D platformers is that the 2D genre in specific has not had much support in recent years as 3D becomes more preferred over it. This has left its 2D counterpart without the modern advances of recent AI techniques. For us, this has led to the decision to tackle the problems of line of sight, image recognition of the level, and pathfinding. All three of these techniques are detailed further below in Development of three AI techniques for 2D platform games in the Resources section. We also feel that this project fits well with all our interests and backgrounds.
	Our motivation for doing this as our project first and foremost comes from our collective enjoyment of video games. We have also had those moments when we complained about the AI in a game not being good enough and with this project, we will surely get a better idea of the process of creating AI in a game and see if we really had much room to complain or if we actually might be able to make a better AI than the ones that we were dissappointed by. Similar concerns can briefly be found in Amit's Game Programming Information below in the Resources section. Regardless of our experience, the video game industry is always looking to improve in all aspects with the games being released, and this is the beginning into the kind of work needed to make those advancements from game to game. Furthermore, the types of problems we hope to look into are able to be applied outside of video games in much more generic contexts and then reapplied to the specifics of another area of programming entirely. Our efforts in making this project will also lend to us having experience desireable nonetheless the path taking in getting those experiences.	
	As for the kinds of tools we intend to use for gaining the desired experiences at this point so far, we have currently decided upon using Unity to create the game and use the A* algorithm for the implementation of pathfinding. Greater details on this algorithm may be found below under Introduction to A* in the Resources section. Other tools or algorithms are likely to be needed but need more consideration and nevertheless have the potential to change. The tools already outlined should not present too great of challenges due to our at least partial familiarity with them but will still expose us to concepts we could do with more experience with.
	In conclusion, we hope to be able to have a 2D platform game as our ultimate deliverable. In it, we plan to have various AIs with various techniques implemented. We also plan to have at least one AI with multiple behaviours and multiple techniques implemented. From creating this, we should gain valuable experience with AI in a wide scope and in other aspects of a diverse nature.
